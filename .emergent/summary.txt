<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully initiated development by cloning the user's  React Native project. Key tasks included migrating the application to a new codebase, preparing it for Heroku deployment (frontend and backend), replacing the LLM integration from Emergent to OpenAI, and switching the payment gateway from Stripe to Mercado Pago for subscriptions. Significant effort was spent debugging frontend display issues related to subscription status, API URL configuration, and React context errors. The engineer also addressed an initial bug where new users automatically received a free trial. The current focus is on implementing Mercado Pago's recurring payment preapproval API, a task that is currently in progress. Challenges included Git credential issues, persistent local caching (Metro bundler), and correctly configuring environment variables across platforms and services.

The user's core request was to migrate an existing React Native project (, later ) into the provided Expo template environment. Subsequent explicit requests include:
1.  **Deployment**: Prepare the full-stack application for deployment on Heroku, specifically using the Heroku dashboard interface. This involved creating necessary s, , updating  scripts, and configuring , , , , , , , and  via Heroku Config Vars.
2.  **LLM Integration**: Replace the  LLM with direct **OpenAI** API calls in the backend, utilizing a user-provided API key.
3.  **Payment Gateway**: Replace **Stripe** payment integration with **Mercado Pago** for subscription payments. The user explicitly requested to focus only on subscriptions, not other payment types like ebooks or corporate checkout.
4.  **Subscription Logic**:
    *   Initially, new user accounts were inadvertently created with an active subscription. This was fixed to prevent automatic subscriptions.
    *   A new requirement emerged for new users to receive a **1-day free trial**, which should be reflected on the home screen.
5.  **Frontend Display & Functionality**: Ensure the subscription status card (including trial days) is correctly displayed on the home screen. Ensure the subscription checkout process (Mercado Pago) correctly redirects users on both mobile (Android emulator) and web platforms.
6.  **Recurring Payments**: Implement **recurring subscription payments** using Mercado Pago's preapproval API.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing **recurring payments** using the **Mercado Pago preapproval API** in the backend. This involves modifying . The engineer has successfully researched the Mercado Pago preapproval API and made an initial edit (Chat Message 915) to integrate the  SDK for preapproval creation. The specific task at hand is to complete the  statement for the  function to handle the response from the Mercado Pago preapproval API call. This is the direct continuation of replacing the single-payment Mercado Pago integration with a recurring payment system.
